Notes from the class, started by the professor and updated by the class

These files are text files and you are welcome to edit them.  Please be careful as they are a resource for the entire class.
It features a simple interface, Material Design, and a tag system for easier organization. 

In making changes, feel free to fix misspellings, add information/clarification.  You can also reorganize, however please be aware that not everyone will see things the same way.  My suggestion when making a change is to make the change in your copy of this repository, and then do a pull request.  Do not come to this repository and pull it in, but instead use that pull request as an indication of what your proposal is, and askfor feedback on it (you can add comments in any of the pull requests.)  Once others have reviewed and given feedback about the proposed change, you ahve made further changes, and the people who choose to take part in the conversation are happy with it, then commit the pull request to the class repo.

Note: If you create a pull request, and then want to make further changes before you have it pulled in.  All you need to do is make the additional change to your copy of the repository on GitHub, and commit it there.  That will cause your pull request to be automatically updated.


An additional note.  These files have an extension of .md which stands for the markdown style of text formatting.  This is not something that you need to be worried about, as most of the text editing you would do will work just fine.
If you want to see what the options are, or want to find how to format something in a specific way, this is a handy visual guide to the formatting styles:
