## CloneToPersonalGitHubRepo

You need to have a personal account on GitHub.

* Go to the class repo you would like to copy into your space on GitHub.
* Click the fork button.
* Select your name in the window that comes up.

You should now have a copy of the repository that has what was current at the time you created the copy.


## CloneToPersonalComputer

You need to have GitBash installed on your computer if you are running windows.  
If not using windows, then install Git, and use the command line instead of GitBash in these instructions.

* Go to the repo in your personal space on GitHub (your user name will be in the upper left.)
* Click the green "Clone or Download"button on the right hand side.
* Copy the link that is shown here (note that clicking on the clipboard icon will copy the text.)
* In GitBash, navigate to the folder you want te repository to be located in (use the 'cd' command.)
* Run the command: 'git clone ' and past the link you copied above.  Then hit return.

You should now have a folder with the name of the repository at the location you are at on the computer.
Inside that should be the files that were in the repository when you cloned it.
